                <p>Spring Cloud, to distributed & micro-services architecture is
                    what spring core was to monoliths all through 2004 to 2015. It is a
                    robust platform from pivotal that can stand as backbone of any large

            <p class="services-overview">When architects were designing &
                developing monolith enterprise solutions with EJBs, spring provided a
                modular platform to develop similar enterprise-grade applications
                that can be deployed in a simple & standard (light-weight) servlet
                container. You could plug-n-play services like messaging &amp;
                transaction management into your POJOs, instead of creating EJBs and
                deploying them on full blown app servers.</p>
            <p class="services-overview">Now, that the world has moved towards
                micro-services, spring has again provided a state-of-the-art set of
                tools under the framework called Spring Cloud that facilitates
                implementation of distributed systems. Implementation of distributed
                systems leads to boiler plate patterns. Using Spring Cloud,
                developers can quickly stand up services and applications that
                implement these patterns.</p>
