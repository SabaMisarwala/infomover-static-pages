            <p class="services-overview">We have been implementing spring
                integration based data flow pipelines since many years. Also we have
                been writing spring batch based applications to implement batch
                processing applications. But then these were all monoliths that did
                scale but not very efficiently.</p>
    
            <p class="services-overview">With Spring Cloud Data Flow, you can
                now deploy each spring integration application as a micro-service
                along with its IntegrationFlow. Also, each spring batch component is
                a micro-service. Moreover, you can build real-time data pipelines by
                selecting source, processor &amp; sink components on the fly.</p>
    
            <p class="services-overview">You may deploy your applications on
                top of K8s, Apache Mesos, Yarn or Cloud Foundry.</p>
