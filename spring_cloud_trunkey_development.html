                    </div>
    
                    <p class="service-points">During the inception phase, we carve
                        out the use case model and an analysis model. We also create a
                        candidate architecture and a test & deployment plan. We arrive at
                        guesstimates which we share with you and your other stakeholders.
                        This phase usually has one iteration (sprint) which is of 2/3 weeks
                        depending on the complexity and size of the application. The team
                        involved is usually a senior solution architect and senior
                        technical architect. In case of large applications, we may have to
                        run more than one sprint in the inception phase with more
                        resources.</p>
    
                    <p class="service-points">All in all - the goal of this phase is
                        to get the candidate architecture & get the guesstimates.</p>
    
                    <p class="service-points">If you and your team have already
                        executed this phase, then we can directly start with elaboration
                        phase.</p>

                    <h3 class="headline-brd">Elaboration Phase</h3>
                </div>
                <p class="service-points">The objective of elaboration phase is
                    to validate and baseline the architecture. A robust and rock-solid
                    architecture is imperative for a system that can stand the test of
                    time. In this phase we prioritize use cases (critical, important and
                    ancillary) and then focus on those that are architecturally
                    significant; those that are critical; those that contain risk of
                    high magnitude. We detail them and then move on to design and
                    implement them. We then test these architectural components with the
                    help of role based use cases of the system. For e.g. Security
                    components are tested by demonstrating one use case scenario where
                    only an authenticated and authorized user can access the given part
                    of the system. This helps in validating the architecture and thereby
                    base-lining it.</p>
    
                <p class="service-points">By the end of this phase, we complete
                    the implementation of all architecturally significant components and
                    cover all risks. No unknowns, no critical question unanswered - all
                    risks covered or atleast mitigated.</p>
    
                <p class="service-points">Note that the artifacts developed in
                    this phase are not throw-away prototypes but rock-solid
                    architectural components on top of which the rest of the system is
                    built. These components sets the stage to implement services on top
                    of Eureka for discovery service, ZUUL for intelligent & dynamic
                    routing, Spring Config Sleuth for tracing, Spring OAuth 2.0 for
                    security of micro-services etc.</p>
    
                <p class="service-points">In case the system needs integration or
                    data-flow pipelines we develop reusable source, processor (for
                    validation, enrichment and conversion) and sink component are
                    developed in this phase so that in construction phase, developers
                    can build sophisticated data flow pipelines.</p>
    
                <p class="service-points">Integration Flow(s) in Spring
                    Integration are built to verify and test the connectivity with
                    external systems.</p>
    
                <p class="service-points">Finally we do a deployment of role
                    based use cases that helps testing the architecture in QA
                    environment to validate and prove the viability of all architectural
                    components.</p>
    
                <p class="service-points">To summarize, all the stakeholder's of
                    the system will have sound sleep towards the end of this phase
                    simply because all architectural risks are covered.</p>
    
                <p class="service-points">This phase usually takes 4 to 8 weeks
                    with senior architects & tech-leads.</p>
    
                <p class="service-points">It is important to note that all our
                    architects and tech-leads are completely hands-on and they
                    personally implement components in this phase; they are not paper
                    tigers :)</p>

                    <p class="service-points">This is the phase where we put our
                        entire team of programmers to develop rest of the system, sprint by
                        sprint - iteratively and incrementally. The salient feature of our
                        development style is that each spring will produce a deployable
                        unit; atleast from 3rd or the 4th sprint.</p>
    
                    <p class="service-points">Our TDD approach and strong expertise
                        on automated CI / CD ensures that we keep integrating and
                        delivering the features to different testing and release
                        environments.</p>
    
                    <p class="service-points">All in all - you get set of features
                        deployed in your QA / Staging such that it is ready for all types
                        of testing.</p>
    
                    <p class="service-points">The number of resources needed and the
                        time taken during this phase is dependent on the size of the
