                        of micro services software solutions. We are pioneers in
                        architecting large, enterprise wide micro services based solutions

                        <p class="services-overview">Wants a 3rd eye to review the
                            spring cloud based micro-services architecture that your team has
                            already put in place ? We do review & assessment of spring cloud
                            based micro-services architecture and present a report that help
                            our customers to fine-tune.</p>
    
    
                        <p class="services-overview">We do the following & produce
                            valuable deliverables when engaged for such an assignment.</p>
    
                        <p class="services-overview">We study the problem statement and
                            meticulously identify requirements that are architecturally
                            significant - the ones that has impact on the architecture. We
                            check the level of detailing done by your team of such
                            requirements to make sure that everything that may have impact on
                            the architecture is well covered and detailed. In our experience,
                            missing on details of architecturally significant requirements
                            results in serious flaws and gaps in the architecture.</p>
    
                        <p class="services-overview">Usually the synergy between
                            components / frameworks / APIs are not tested and proven. We do
                            small PoCs keeping the focus on architectural requirements and
                            highlight risks of using the product / framework in the
                            architecture. For e.g. in one of the projects we reviewed, the
                            architect had selected KIE Workbench as a solution to creating
                            rules; we analyzed the rules related requirement and realized that
                            the detailed level design of associating rules with the fields
                            that needs to be processed will be overwhelming and tedious to
                            maintain. An alternative (better) solution was suggested by us.</p>
    
                        <p class="services-overview">We check whether there are any
                            better frameworks / products to replace the ones that are selected
                            by your architects, do small PoC(s) and demonstrate the same.</p>
    
                        <p class="services-overview">We also take a deep-dive into the
                            deployment architecture of your micro-services solution and
                            provide our recommendations.</p>
    
                        <p class="services-overview">We finally produce a report that
                            presents the recommendations on each and every aspect of the
                            architecture - right from the logical view to the deployment view.
                            In this report, we endorse what ever is already perfect and
                            recommend where we see better approach.</p>

                        organization, that is needed to maintain the deployment platform.
                        Based on these and various other data points which we will gather
                        during our discussions with your team, we will present the most
